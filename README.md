How to build using Github For Windows

Read this section if you intend to build the  projects only, and read the section on Preparing clones for forked contributions in addition to this section if you intend to make code changes you want to share.

Download Github for Windows and install it.
Using Github for Windows clone the  repository to your local drive, for example, into ....Documents/Github/ClearCanvas.
Using Github for Windows clone the  to your local drive, for example into ....Documents/Github/ReferencedAssemblies.

Build.
Preparing clones for forked contributions

If you intend to make changes to the code and contribute it to the  repository, then you must first use Fork on Github.com to create a clone of  on Github.com. The  repository itself is moderated and you will not be able to automatically publish your changes to it.

Therefore,

Use Fork on Github.com to create a clone of . For example, to yourUserName/.
If you intend to make changes to the , make a fork/clone of this repository as well. Otherwise, it is unnecessary to do so.
Download Github for Windows and install it.

Create a symbolic link so that ReferencedAssemblies can be referenced from within your ClearCanvas directory.
You are now ready to make changes to the code in your private fork/clone.
